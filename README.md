Overview
The Real Estate AI project aims to build a regression model that predicts the sale price of a house based on a set of input features. The project leverages the Ames Housing dataset, which contains detailed information about houses in Ames, Iowa.

Key Features
Data Loading: The project reads data from a CSV file using ML.NET's data loading functionalities.
Feature Engineering: Key features like Overall Quality, Living Area, Garage Size, and more are used to train the model.
Model Training: The project uses the FastTreeRegressionTrainer algorithm to train the model.
Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using R² (coefficient of determination) to measure accuracy.
Prediction: The trained model can predict the sale price of a house based on input features.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
.NET SDK: .NET 6.0 or later
Visual Studio 2022: Recommended IDE for development
ML.NET: Included as a NuGet package


Steps to Setup the Project

1. Clone the Repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RealEstateAI.git  
   cd RealEstateAI

2. Open the Project in Visual Studio:
    Open RealEstateAI.sln in Visual Studio 2022.

3. Restore Dependencies:
    Restore the required NuGet packages by building the solution (Ctrl + Shift + B).

4. Prepare the Dataset:
    Ensure the HouseData.csv file is located in the Data/ directory.

5. Run the Project:
    Press F5 to build and run the project.
 
 
Training the Model
    The model is trained using the FastTreeRegressionTrainer algorithm, which is a decision tree-based algorithm suitable for regression tasks.

Training Steps:

1. Load the Data:

    The dataset is loaded from the HouseData.csv file using ML.NET’s LoadFromTextFile method.

2. Define the Pipeline:

    Features are concatenated and normalized using MLContext.Transforms. The FastTreeRegressionTrainer is appended to the pipeline for training.

3. Train the Model:

    The model is trained on the data using the Fit method.

4. Evaluate the Model:

    The model is evaluated using R², with a high value indicating good predictive accuracy.

5. Making Predictions

  After training, the model can be used to predict the sale price of a house based on new input data.

6. Example Prediction:

  var predictionEngine = mlContext.Model.CreatePredictionEngine<HouseData, HousePricePrediction>(model);
  var newHouse = new HouseData  
  {
    OverallQual = 7,
    GrLivArea = 2000,
    GarageCars = 2,
    GarageArea = 500,
    TotalBsmtSF = 850,
    FirstFlrSF = 1000,
    FullBath = 2,
    YearBuilt = 2005,
    YearRemodAdd = 2005,
    LotArea = 8000
  };
var prediction = predictionEngine.Predict(newHouse);
Console.WriteLine($"Predicted Sale Price: {prediction.SalePrice:C}");


Model Performance

  R²: The model achieved an R² value of 0.97, indicating that it explains 97% of the variance in the house prices.
  Prediction Example: The model predicted a sale price of approximately $227,457.73 for a sample house.

  
Further Improvements
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters of the FastTree model or try alternative algorithms to potentially improve the R² value.
Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well.
Feature Engineering: Add or modify features to capture more complex relationships in the data.
